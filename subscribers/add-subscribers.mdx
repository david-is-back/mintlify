You can add subscribers manually or importing a CSV file

## 1. Manually

- **Subject**: This is the subject line of your email. Itâ€™s what recipients will see in their inbox, so make it clear, engaging, and relevant to increase open rates.

<Warning>
  Don't be spammy. Try to craft compelling titles but don't overuse emojis, symbols or use words that urge your subscribers.
</Warning>

- **Subtitle**: This is the first line shown in the email preview (also known as the preheader text). It provides additional context to encourage readers to open the email.

A well-crafted subject and subtitle can significantly impact email engagement.

## 2. Post Settings

If you check the **"Post on website"** box, your content will be published on your website along with being sent as an email.

If left unchecked, the post will only be sent via email.

### Meta tags

These fields help optimize how your post appears in search engines and social media previews:

- **Meta Title**: The title that appears in search engines and when sharing the post. This should be clear, engaging, and relevant to your topic.
- **Meta Description**: A short description that summarizes your post. This is also used as the preview text in emails.
- **Slug**: The unique part of the URL for your post (e.g., `your-post-url`). It should be simple and related to the topic.

### Search Engine Preview

This section shows how your post will appear in search results, including:

- The **title** (from the meta title field). The text after the **|** is your newsletter's name and can't be removed here. To change it, go to **Settings**.
- The **URL** (with the slug you entered).
- A preview of the **meta description** if provided.

This preview helps ensure your post looks professional and appealing in search engines.

### Image Thumbnail

- You can upload an **image thumbnail** that will be used when sharing the post on social media or embedding it elsewhere. It's also the post image that will be displayed on your website.
- The recommended size is **1200px x 630px** for the best quality.

## 3. Delivery Settings

This is the final step before sending your post. Here, you choose **who** will receive your email and **when** it will be delivered.

### Select Your Target Audience

This section lets you choose which group of subscribers will receive the email.

- **Audience List Dropdown**: Select the subscriber segment you want to target.
  - **All Subscribers Option**: If you select this from the dropdown menu, the email will be sent to all your subscribers. If you have multiple segments, you can choose a specific group instead.
- **Summary Box**: Displays the selected audience and how many people will receive it.
- **Create and Manage Segments**: Clicking this lets you create and manage different audience groups for targeted emails. It will take you to the another menu of the navigation bar, but don't worry because your email and configuration won't be lost.

### Select a Delivery Method

Decide when to send your email:

- **Send email right now**: The email will be sent immediately.
- **Schedule mail delivery**: Allows you to choose a future date and time to send the email. This is useful if you want to optimize timing for better engagement or you want to plan several posts ahead in time. A scheduled mail can be modified from the Posts menu.

You've just finished creating and sending your very first newsletter. Well done ðŸ¥³
