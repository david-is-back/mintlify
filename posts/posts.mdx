In LetterBucket, once you send an email, it becomes a **Post**. Why? Because it’s not just sent to your audience’s inboxes, it’s also **published on your website** automatically.

Think of it like this: the email is done (you can’t edit or resend it), but the content lives on as a web post you can keep updating.

Can you make changes after sending? **Absolutely.** While the email itself is locked in (since it’s already been delivered), the web version is fully editable.

You can tweak the copy, update links, add media, fix typos, whatever you need. It’s your live post, and you’re in control.

## Post Filter (Dropdown)

- Lets you filter posts by type or status (e.g. Draft, Posted, Scheduled).
- Super helpful when you’ve got a long list and want to find something quickly.

## Post Cards

Each card represents one post and gives you quick access to its status, stats, and actions:

### 1. Draft Post

- **Label:** Labeled as "Draft", this post hasn’t been sent or published yet.
- **Stats:** Not available yet, because it hasn’t been delivered.
- **Trash Icon:** Lets you delete the draft directly from here.

### 2. Delivered Post

- **Label:** Labeled as "Delivered", this one has already been sent and published.
- **Basic Stats:**
  - **Sent to:** Number of recipients.
  - **CTR:** Click-through rate (how many clicked something inside the email).
  - **Open Rate:** Percentage of people who opened the email.

### 3. Scheduled Post

- **Label:** Labeled as "Scheduled", this one is waiting until it reaches the programmed time. You can see this by hovering the clock icon and edit it to change the content or the date of sending. To do so, click on the 3 dots on the upper right side of the card.
