## Key Metrics

Here you can find the engament metrics of your newsletter:

- **Total Subscribers:** Displays the total number of people subscribed to your newsletter. This is an essential metric to track audience growth.
- **Total Unique Opens:** Refers to the number of distinct individuals who have opened an email at least once. Even if a recipient opens the email multiple times, they are counted only once in this metric.
- **Total Unique Clicks:** It's the number of distinct recipients who clicked on at least one link in an email. Even if a recipient clicks multiple links or the same link multiple times, they are counted only once in this metric. It helps measure engagement and the effectiveness of call-to-actions.
