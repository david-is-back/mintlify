## Key Metrics

Here you can find the engament metrics of your newsletter:

- **Total Subscribers:** Displays the total number of people subscribed to your newsletter. This is an essential metric to track audience growth.
- **Total Unique Opens:** Refers to the number of distinct individuals who have opened an email at least once. Even if a recipient opens the email multiple times, they are counted only once in this metric.
- **Total Unique Clicks:** It's the number of distinct recipients who clicked on at least one link in an email. Even if a recipient clicks multiple links or the same link multiple times, they are counted only once in this metric. It helps measure engagement and the effectiveness of call-to-actions.

## Your Site

On the upper right side you'll find all the information related to your site on LetterBucket:

- \*\*Homepage URL: \*\*Shows the website or landing page associated with your LetterBucket account.
- \*\*Open Site Button: \*\*Opens your website in a new tab.
- \*\*Copy Button: \*\*Copies the website URL to the clipboard for easy sharing.

This is your personal blog, where all the emails you send will be published by default. Once published, these posts can be discovered through search engines, and readers can subscribe to your newsletter.

**You have full control over what gets posted**. After writing an email, you'll be able to review the settings and choose whether or not to publish it on your site.

## Delivered posts

On the lower right side, you'll find the stats of your most recent sends.

- \*\*Campaign Title: \*\*The name of the latest sent email or post.
- \*\*Type of Post (Web post & Email): \*\*Indicates that the content was published as both a web post and an email. During the sending process you can decide if you want to publish the post on your website or not.
- \*\*Sent to-\> All subs: \*\*Specifies the audience for this email campaign (in this case, all subscribers).
- \*\*CTR (Click-Through Rate): \*\*The percentage of email recipients who clicked on at least one link in the email.

## Graphs

These graph tracks the most important stats of your newsletter, subscribers and engagement.

### Subscribers (Last 7 Days)

This graph tracks the number of new subscribers you've gained over the past week.

- The x-axis shows the **dates**
- The y-axis shows the **number of total subscribers**
- Each data point (small green circles) marks how many new subscribers you got on that specific day.

### Engagement (CTR vs Open Rate)

This section appears just below the first graph.

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate**): the percentage of people who clicked a link inside your emails.
- **Open Rate**: the percentage of people who opened your emails.

This comparison helps you gauge how engaging your subject lines are (open rate) and how compelling your content or calls-to-action are (CTR).

This graph would give you a clear picture of how well your audience is interacting with your emails beyond just opening them.

Now let's dive into the text editor.
